# messaging-app


This is a command line chat application that uses a reliable data transfer protocol on top of UDP to ensure that the application can tolerate lost and corrupted packets.  It handles error detection, retransmission, and timeouts.

Run one instance of server.py and two instances of client.py and send messages inbetween them.
